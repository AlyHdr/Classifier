# Classifier

## Description
This project was implemented to test the different algorithms used in classification and clustersing
on 3 different data sets to compare the effieciency of the algorithms.

## Implemented Algos
 * Normalization
 * MSS
 * KNN
 * Bayes

## Results
The algos were tested on the 3 data sets were there is an interface implemented to show the results of the algos
and compare the accuracy of each algorithm were its calculated for each algorithm.
